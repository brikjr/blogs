    <h1>Music & Me: Sector 71 Guys</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">December 22, 2024</p>
    <p>The Delhi trap scene has been a sonic adventure, a raw expression of life in the streets. My journey began with Vasudev’s early work; his Ghaziabad Mixtape was packed with raw energy, while the Delhi Metro Series showcased a refreshing perspective. Unfortunately, Vasudev faded from the spotlight..</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>but Delhi Trap had another plans, and that’s where the Sector 71 guys emerged, carrying the torch and redefining Delhi’s trap sound.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As <strong>Raftaar</strong> aptly described the scene:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brodie kuch bhi kehdo fancy,<br />
Yahan na koi gang shi,<br />
Sab rapperon ki family,<br />
Yahan 90 percent panzis</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brother spitting fancy,<br />
There’s no gang shit here,<br />
All the rappers have families,<br />
and yeah, 90 percent are posers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sector 71 guys stood out for being REAL AF! So, who are these Sector 71 guys?  <br /><br /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ab-17"><strong>Ab 17</strong></h3>

<p>An absolute legend in the making. His debut track, <em>Gande Ilake Se</em> (<em>From the Bad Area</em>), where he speaks about how he’s from a bad area and his dream is to get out; narrating the struggle of rising from  the grasp of a rough neighborhood.</p>

<p><br />
His EP, <em>Tez Filam</em>, is a masterpiece. It’s raw, authentic, and unapologetic, embodying the life of Indian streets; people watching your steps closely, they don’t want you to get out and make it. With his pronunciation of words like “कलोनी” (<em>Kaloni</em> instead of Colony) reflect his roots and social commentary, adding a layer of authenticity that connects with listeners on a personal level.
<br />

<h3 id="lil-bhavi"><strong>Lil Bhavi</strong></h3>

<p>While vibing to Ab 17, Lil Bhavi dropped <em>Laal Neeli</em> (<em>Red Blue</em>), a banger about the doomy flashing lights of police cars; a narrative typically found in Western rap but brought to Indian audiences with a fresh perspective; Indian Streets.</p>

<p><br />
He truly outdid himself in a feature on Seedhe Maut’s <em>Peace of Mind</em> it was a pure display that he LOVES his art and doesn’t care about the fame. He chose to mumble in that track; mumble is often controversial and not well understood. A dream collab for many would be to get a feature verse with Seedhe Maut a platform to flex your art and Bhavi chose to mumble his way through it. 
<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="bhaskar"><strong>Bhaskar</strong></h3>
<p>Bhaskar is unfiltered, pure, and undeniably <strong>crass</strong>. His raw, unapologetic style, combined with his heavy use of autotune, creates a polarizing sound that has pushed Delhi trap into new dimensions.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>His art often ventures into controversial territory, with lyrics that include inappropriate references to women, and/or overly graphic explanation; making his approach both provocative and questionable.</p>

<p><br />
For me, it’s just art and I keep Bhaskar and Lil Bhavi as my favourites from Sector 71.
<br />

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="og-lucifer"><strong>OG Lucifer</strong></h3>
<p>OG Lucifer is the energy center of the scene. Every project he touches becomes an anthem. His ability to use trap as a sonic choice over the form of rap is proof that music is art and is a medium to amplify meaningful stories.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/58FxNIJWUo3aedY37PI7nH?utm_source=generator&amp;theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p><br />
My personal favorite from the Sector 71 guys is a track named <em>Seven One</em>, he tackles serious societal issues over hard-hitting trap beats.  <em>Seven One</em> opens with Bhaskar’s impactful commentary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“मेरी स्ट्रीट लाइफ मेरी रियल लाइफ  <br />
मेरे गाने बस करते है मेरे फीलिंग्स को आजाद”</em> <br />
<em>“My street life is my real life, <br />
My songs just set my feelings free”</em> <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/31AkhCMuU0vHfhmhZmoSXH?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>This track is a masterpiece; a raw, honest expression of emotions wrapped in a trap beat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“बावे दिल्ली की हवा मै उदासी फ्रे है”</em>  <br />
(<em>Delhi’s air is heavy with melancholy</em>)  <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“शायद बावे करता करता मै मर जाऊंगा seven one”</em>  <br />
(<em>Perhaps I’ll die working through this grind of Seven One</em>)  <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tntbeats"><strong>TNTBeats</strong></h3>

<p>TNT got them here; The Backbone of the Scene, Sector 71 movement wouldn’t be what it is without TNT Beats. TNT’s production is the emotional core of these tracks, perfectly complementing the raw lyricism and unfiltered narratives of the artists. TNT’s beats encapsulate the chaos, struggles, and triumphs of Delhi’s streets.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="seedhe-maut-the-ogs-the-legends-and-the-mentors"><strong>Seedhe Maut: The OGs, The Legends, and The Mentors</strong></h3>

<p>Massive respect is due to <strong>Seedhe Maut</strong> for nurturing this talent. They didn’t just collaborate; they gave them the stage. Tracks like <em>Batti</em> featuring Ab 17, <em>Taakat</em> featuring Lil Bhavi, and the iconic <em>Peace of Mind</em> brought Sector 71 to the forefront. Seedhe Maut’s dedication to the scene is unparalleled; they’re married to it, loyal to its roots, and always elevating the culture truly a DL91 era (label that was made by Seedhe Maut and signed these artists).<br />
<br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br />
Delhi’s trap scene has OGs like DRV, Qaab and Rawal. Sector 71 guys, are new age with their distinct voices and vision are making a difference.</p>
