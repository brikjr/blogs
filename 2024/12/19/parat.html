    <h1>Music & Me - Parat </h1>
    <p class="post-meta">December 19, 2024</p>
    <p>While listening to this EP and looking at the album art, I found myself overwhelmed with emotion. It wasn’t just a collection of songs; it felt like a mirror.</p>

<p><br />
I’m talking about the EP Parat by AFKAP. 
<br />
<br /></p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://theindianmusicdiaries.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/12/AFKAP-parat.jpg.webp" alt="AFKAP - Parat Album Art" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; height: auto;" />
</p>

<p><br />
<br />
AFKAP is wearing a duhle ka sehra with a regular sweater and shirt in the cover art. The contrast is striking—no flashiness, just simplicity—symbolizing his lower-middle-class background. This middle-class upbringing is crucial to the EP’s narrative. In India, being born into a middle-class family means carrying a growing weight of responsibilities as you age. The sehra signifies the burden of family, relatives, and societal expectations.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The open wounds on AFKAP’s face reflect the struggles and challenges of a middle-class life. Yet, amidst all this chaos, he holds a small cup of chai. In Indian culture, chai is a moment of comfort, and for AFKAP, it becomes a metaphor for the little joys that make life bearable. This simple pleasure represents his passion and art; his music.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>AFKAP narrates his struggles and responsibilities in a subtle, non-complaining way, presenting them as an inevitable part of life. This EP is a collection of those simple pleasures amidst the chaos of responsibilities and hardships.</p>

<h2 id="track-1">Track 1:</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4I7BdHJSsX4vPA0S3cCuWt?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The first track, Rukawat, opens with the voice of an Indian aunty interrupting the song, a metaphor for societal expectations getting in the way of his passion. She talks about marriage—a direct reference to responsibilities. The lyrics are packed with hard-hitting lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>जो भी सपनों के पीछे भागा, उसके पैरों पर लगी है आग।<br />
<em>Whoever runs after dreams, their feet are on fire.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>AFKAP talks about the pressure to prove your success if you dare to follow your dreams. Otherwise, you’re expected to stick to the norms. He also talks about his personal conflict: his longing to return to Delhi versus the responsibilities that bind him to Mumbai.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>सपने सच हो रहे यहाँ, वापिस जाने की मेरी भी चाह है लेकिन कंधों पे भार है।<br />
<em>My dreams are coming true here, but I wish to go back, Yet I can’t because of the weight I carry.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This track is the perfect introduction to the EP, offering a glimpse into the classic middle-class story of balancing dreams and duties.</p>

<h2 id="track-2">Track 2:</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6M2E0pLMPyEjNgyUgMyDf6?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This three-year-old track is a timeless commentary on how society molds you into what it wants you to be. AFKAP brilliantly conveys this with metaphors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone is carrying glass but no mirror. Everyone is ready to criticize but unwilling to introspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The track explores the constant tug-of-war between societal expectations, personal values, and the voices of parents, friends, and community. It’s a reminder of how rare self-reflection is in a world full of judgments.</p>

<h2 id="track-3">Track 3:</h2>

<p><br /></p>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4eGiJtQcpdmsiBJAUvsSMW?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>AFKAP uses his bike accident as a metaphor for life. He reflects on the importance of going slow and steady, emphasizing the dangers of rushing towards goals. It’s a lesson in patience and endurance, a call to embrace life’s journey without crashing under its weight.</p>

<h2 id="track-4">Track 4:</h2>

<p><br /></p>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1ZgkwdFj3mLvkvE7WswObI?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>This track, with its emo drill beat, explores attachments. AFKAP reflects on how his materialistic attachments have grown, while his real, emotional connections have started to fade. Lines like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>राहें हो जाती अलग है, फिर भी हाथ पकड़ने का मन है।<br />
<em>Paths may diverge, but I still want to hold your hand.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>capture the bittersweet nature of changing priorities and relationships.</p>

<h2 id="track-5">Track 5:</h2>

<p><br /></p>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/47I3fpVKJ3qRQuFgiKel0U?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p><br />
This is my favorite track of the EP. Featuring a saxophone and packed with flex rap, it hits hard. The lyrics exude confidence and resilience:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>अगर खोने को होता ही है नहीं, तो पाता सब कुछ मैं।<br />
<em>If I had nothing to lose, I’d win at everything</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even with the weight of responsibilities, AFKAP maintains a calm and effortless tone. This track feels fearless, a celebration of risks and rewards. It’s the kind of song that deserves a blog of its own!</p>

<h2 id="track-6">Track 6:</h2>

<p><br /></p>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0hH6iQRwZ1XP2cvDXMuEwv?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The final track is pure art; a raw, emotional conversation with himself. While the rest of the EP focuses on struggles and responsibilities, this song is about acceptance. AFKAP steps into the shoes of his family, viewing his life from their perspective. This shift brings a sense of balance and closure, showing that everyone acts based on their own understanding of the world.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>This EP isn’t just a collection of songs; it’s a mirror to life itself. When art can make you cry, reflect, and feel seen that’s when you know it’s something special.</strong></p>
