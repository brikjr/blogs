    <h1>Music & Me - Raftaar</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">January 25, 2025</p>
    <p>If this blog was about Raftaar. You probably don’t need a blog. It could be summed up in a word: a legend or a Wikipedia article. But he has that big brother tag to him, and he lives by it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>He’s an OG in the scene. Desi hip-hop began with Raftaar. I wasn’t early in the game, so I didn’t follow his super early Mafia Mundeer or Bluetooth-era phase. I was busy with rock music, and I wrote about my journey in my first blog.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I always knew he made a big name and music in Bollywood, but that music didn’t matter to me. My very first introduction on the underground scene was when he collaborated for a parody song “Cute Vol. 1” with a YouTube channel, TVF. Seeing that was refreshing. Someone who is a big shot in the industry is making a song and a music video for a YouTube channel when YouTube wasn’t even big.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>He also collaborated with an eSports player, ScoutOP, when in COVID, he was in lockdown and showcased that he is one of us rather than a Bollywood celebrity and also gave a shout-out to this player.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I liked Raftaar’s collabs with different artists. His drill track in Krsna’s EP, where he is taking inspiration from Pop Smoke’s Brooklyn Drill, mixed with Krsna’s classic South London drill.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The first biggest hip-hop beef that blew out of proportion in 2018 was between Raftaar and Emiway, where I saw his true lyricism.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Where I really loved Raftaar was his work in Hard Drive Vol. 1 EP. That album was when Raftaar decided to showcase what he had for the underground scene, and he’s not a sellout. Every track was an absolute banger.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I was introduced to trap sound by Raftaar himself. By his EP PRAA and the song TRAP PRAA, and man, that was refreshing and new!!! It sounds like an end credit song of a movie who made it big from nothing.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>By this time with Hard Drive Vol. 1, Raftaar established why he is a living legend in DHH. He is a better lyricist than Krsna. I am a Krsna fanboy, but I can’t lie about who is better because this was proven later.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Hard Drive Vol. 2. Absolute banger once again and 0 misses. Every song had a killer hook. He doesn’t try to be young, new age. He showcases his wisdom, knowledge, and skills in songs like REAL SHIT.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What’s missing is a banger album from him. We have killer EPs, but an album is still what’s missing.</p>
